summary: "How Redis caching patterns reduced API latency from 900ms to under 200ms, cut database load by 60%, and eliminated peak-time errors. Real strategies for read-through, write-through, and cache-aside patterns."

It was a Friday afternoon when the alert came in:

"Search API latency has doubled. Customer drop-offs increasing."

In high-traffic systems, every millisecond matters. And in our case, milliseconds were turning into seconds. The backend was hammering the database for the same data over and over — like asking the same question to someone who had already answered a minute ago.

That's when Redis stepped in as our secret weapon.

## The Problem

Our service was handling:

- **Thousands of requests per second**
- **Frequent lookups for data that changed infrequently**
- **A growing number of timeout errors under peak load**

Hitting the database every time was like taking the long road home when a shortcut was available.

## The Redis Approach

We introduced caching patterns to break the cycle:

- **Read-Through Cache** – Data fetched from the DB was stored in Redis automatically for future requests
- **Write-Through Cache** – Updates went to both the DB and Redis at the same time, keeping them in sync
- **Cache-aside** – For infrequent writes but heavy reads, we let the app decide when to pull from Redis or refresh from DB

We also set smart TTLs — short enough to keep data fresh, long enough to avoid unnecessary DB hits.

## The Results

- **Latency dropped from ~900ms to under 200ms** for common queries
- **Database load reduced by 60%**, freeing it to handle truly dynamic data
- **Peak-time errors? Almost gone**

## The Takeaway

Redis isn't just a cache — it's a performance strategy.

It can turn an overworked backend into a responsive, high-performing system, provided you choose the right caching pattern for your data's behavior.

And the best part? When we deployed these patterns, customers didn't notice anything — except that everything just felt faster.
